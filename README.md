Attempt to use QLoRA  and fine tune a large model locally.



### 9/27
Fixed and was able to set up the build grounds for 4-bit quantization. Windows 10 ran into many problems, making linux VM fixed most of the problems.

### 10/1
Dual boot with linux, was able to fix 'missing cudalibrt.so' problem.
The model downloaded was 'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf'.
